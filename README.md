## Future Additions

- Could implement user's to determine their own "hot","cold", and "warm" temperatures.
- Allow user's to upload images from gallery or other areas where images are stored instead of only allowing a url.
- Allow user's to upload multiple images of one item, for different views.
- Allow user's to pair items to include "completed outfits" instead of having individual items.
  - Or create scrollable sections for tops and bottoms so users can choose which items match best with each other.
- Maybe allow user's to "send" items to another user.
